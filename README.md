# art-query

I created this website as a way for the user to reflect upon their tastes in art, and attempt to understand why they enjoy the art that they do. The site consists of a three part quiz in which the user must arrange and rank various pieces of art that change based on previous selections in the quiz. The quiz will then output an "art profile" telling the user about their objective and assumed preferences in art.
